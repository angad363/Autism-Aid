# Autism Aid

## Overview

Autism Aid is an application developed using Python, OpenCV, and the Google Speech Recognition libraries. This project aims to provide assistance in assessing the likelihood of autism in children aged 1-4. The application features various tests and functionalities to collect and analyze data, helping to identify potential signs of autism. Additionally, the project includes a research paper published in IEEE Xplore, discussing the analysis of autism and its characteristics.

## Features

- **Assessment of autism likelihood**: The application provides a range of tests to assess the likelihood of autism in children aged 1-4. These tests utilize computer vision techniques and speech analysis to evaluate specific characteristics associated with autism.
- **Data storage using Google Firebase**: Test results are securely stored in a Google Firebase database, ensuring data integrity and accessibility for further analysis.
- **Statistical analysis**: The project includes functionality to calculate the average percentage of autism based on test results. It also generates monthly and weekly scores for repeated tests, enabling monitoring and tracking of progress.
- **Eye detection test accuracy**: The eye detection test implemented in the application achieves an accuracy of 80%, enabling the detection of specific eye-related characteristics related to autism.
- **Speech analysis test accuracy**: The speech analysis test exhibits an accuracy of 86.7%, providing insights into speech patterns and characteristics that can aid in autism assessment for children.
